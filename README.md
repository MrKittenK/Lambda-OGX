# ùù∫-ùù§ùùòùù¨ - Lambda-OGX

## A single board solution to combine several Original XBOX modifications OpenXenium/OGX360/BlueRetro/spi2par2019/Wireless Bridge/
(Plus additional support circuitry)


I wish to keep a level of Modular-ness to this project, allowng for each version of xbox
to be able to use this.

I also wish to keep this 100% Open Source.
Any and all files should and will be made avalaiable to all. 
So if you contribute, please be aware that your contribution shall be a part of an Open ethos.

 
```
Some Parts so far:

4 AT mega 32U4 are used for OGX360

1 AT mega 32U4 is used for spi2par2019

1 ESP32 is used for BlueRetro and communication with OGX360

1 ESP32 is used for linking all together and possible Wi-Fi?

1 Wi-Fi to Ethernet adapter (Possible use of ESP32?)

1 FPGA is used for OpenXenium

1 PCB to add all of these together. 
```

```
Aditions?

RGB that can tie into the spi lines of the OpenXenium? 
WLED? 
HDMI?
Use as many existing internal connections as is possible. 
```

Why?

Simple, I want to make an Ultra Slim OG-XBOX. To do this i will be removing the DVD drive,
adding in a 2.5" storage solution (ide to sata adapter). Removing the front controller ports,
with the combination of BlueRetro and OGX360 I will be able to use a DS4 pad or a Xinput/HID/XboxOne pad etc. 
As such I will have zero need for plug-in controllers.

In making the Ultra Slim I shall be trying to also provide a custom power supply with regulators etc. 
All Capacitors to be replaced with Solid state caps. But these won't be part of Lambda-OGX, just a cap replace. 

If it is possible to tie each mod together with a custom pre environment I shall try. 
I know that a few solutions already exist provide a pre environment for settings / mod configuration. 

Any and all help welcomed.

This is purely a project of love and learning. 
My first Xbox experiences were in my late teens - early 20s, i am 40 in 2024 and
just purchased a 1.4 XBOX and after seeing the available mods...
Wanted an easy way to tie them all together.
